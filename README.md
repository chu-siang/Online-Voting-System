# Online Voting System

This project is an online voting system developed using **PHP** and **MySQL**. It provides a platform for conducting secure and efficient elections.

## Main Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** 
  Ensure users can securely register and log in to the system.
  
- **Candidate Registration and Management:** 
  Allows for the registration of candidates and management of their information.
  
- **Secure Voting Process:**
  Users can securely log in, submit votes, and ensure vote integrity.
  
- **Vote Counting and Result Display:**
  Accurately counts votes and displays results in real-time.
  
- **Cosign (Co-signature) Feature:** 
  Verifies votes with additional authentication measures.
  
- **Invoicing and Payment Management:** 
  Handles financial transactions related to the voting process.

## The services provided by the system are as follows:

1. **Voting Management**: The system administrator can create voting events, set up voting options, and define the voting deadline. Regular users can vote within the specified time frame.

2. **Authentication**: The system supports user registration and login functionality to ensure that each person can only vote once.

3. **Result Visualization**: The system automatically tallies the votes for each option and presents the results in the form of charts.

4. **Permission Management**: The system differentiates between administrators and regular users. Administrators can manage voting events and users, while regular users can only participate in voting.

5. **Responsive Design**: The system is designed to be responsive, providing a good user experience across different devices.

## Technology Stack

- **PHP:** 
  Server-side programming language.
  
- **MySQL:** 
  Database management system.
  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** 
  Front-end technologies for building the user interface.

## Future Plans

- Implement more voting types, such as multi-choice and ranking.
- Enhance the security of the authentication mechanism, e.g., two-factor authentication.
- Optimize the user experience and visual design of the system.
- Add more administrative features, such as exporting voting data.
